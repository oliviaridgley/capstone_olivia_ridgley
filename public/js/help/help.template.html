  <p>In 1997 Arthur Aron conducted a Social Psychology study to create 'closeness' under controlled circumstances.<br> This study was later picked up in a Modern Love column by The New York Times and rebranded as 'The 36 Questions to Fall in Love'.<br> Folkways is inspired by this idea, that honest conversation can lead to closer interpersonal relationships. </p>
